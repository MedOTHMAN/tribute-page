    <h2><em><u>Who is Diego Maradona ?</u></em></h2>
    <div id="tribute-info">Diego Armando Maradona ; (30 October 1960 – 25 November 2020) was an Argentine professional
      football player and manager. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players in the history of the sport, he was
      one of the two joint winners of the <a id="tribute-link" target="_blank"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_Player_of_the_Century"> FIFA Player of the 20th Century</a>
      award.Maradona's vision, passing, ball control, and dribbling skills were combined with his small stature, which
      gave him a low centre of gravity allowing him to manoeuvre better than most other players. His presence and
      leadership on the field had a great effect on his team's general performance, while he would often be singled out
      by the opposition. In addition to his creative abilities, he possessed an eye for goal and was known to be a free
      kick specialist. A precocious talent, Maradona was given the nickname "El Pibe de Oro" ("The Golden Boy"), a name
      that stuck with him throughout his career.He also had a troubled off-field life and was banned in both 1991 and
      1994 for abusing drugs.

    <h3><em><u>International-career</u></em></h3>
    <div class="international-career">
      <p>During his time with the Argentina national team, Maradona scored 34 goals in 91 appearances. He made his full
        international debut at age 16, against Hungary, on 27 February 1977. Maradona was left off the Argentine squad
        for the 1978 World Cup on home soil by coach César Luis Menotti who felt he was too young at age 17.At age 18,
        Maradona played the 1979 FIFA World Youth Championship in Japan and emerged as the star of the tournament,
        shining in Argentina's 3–1 final win over the Soviet Union, scoring a total of six goals in six appearances in
        the tournament.On 2 June 1979, Maradona scored his first senior international goal in a 3–1 win against Scotland
        at Hampden Park.He went on to play for Argentina in two 1979 Copa América ties during August 1979, a 2–1 loss
        against Brazil and a 3–0 win over Bolivia in which he scored his side's third goal.</p><i

      <ul>
        <li class="world">1982 World Cup :</li>
        <p>Maradona played his first World Cup tournament in 1982 in his new country of residence, Spain. Argentina
          played Belgium in the opening game of the 1982 Cup at the Camp Nou in Barcelona. The Catalan crowd was eager
          to see their new world-record signing Maradona in action, but he did not perform to expectations, as
          Argentina, the defending champions, lost 1–0. Although the team convincingly beat both Hungary and El Salvador
          in Alicante to progress to the second round, there were internal tensions within the team, with the younger,
          less experienced players at odds with the older, more experienced players. With a team that also included such
          players as Mario Kempes, Osvaldo Ardiles, Ramón Díaz, Daniel Bertoni, Alberto Tarantini, Ubaldo Fillol, and
          Daniel Passarella, the Argentine side was defeated in the second round by Brazil and by eventual winners
          Italy. The Italian match is renowned for Maradona being aggressively man-marked by Claudio Gentile, as Italy
          beat Argentina at the Sarrià Stadium in Barcelona, 2–1.</p>
        <li class="world">1986 World Cup :</li>
        <p>Maradona captained the Argentine national team to victory in the 1986 World Cup in Mexico, winning the final
          in Mexico City against West Germany.Throughout the tournament, Maradona asserted his dominance and was the
          most dynamic player of the competition. He played every minute of every Argentina game, scoring five goals and
          making five assists, three of those in the opening match against South Korea at the Olímpico Universitario
          Stadium in Mexico City. His first goal of the tournament came against Italy in the second group game in
          Puebla. Argentina eliminated Uruguay in the first knockout round in Puebla, setting up a match against England
          at the Azteca Stadium, also in Mexico City. After scoring two contrasting goals in the 2–1 quarter-final win
          against England, his legend was cemented. The majesty of his second goal and the notoriety of his first led to
          the French newspaper L'Équipe describing Maradona as "half-angel, half-devil".[80] This match was played with
          the background of the Falklands War between Argentina and the United Kingdom. Replays showed that the first
          goal was scored by striking the ball with his hand. Maradona was coyly evasive, describing it as "a little
          with the head of Maradona and a little with the hand of God". It became known as the "Hand of God".
          Ultimately, on 22 August 2005, Maradona acknowledged on his television show that he had hit the ball with his
          hand purposely, and no contact with his head was made, and that he immediately knew the goal was illegitimate.
          This became known as an international fiasco in World Cup history. The goal stood, much to the wrath of the
          English players.</p>
        <li class="world">1990 World Cup :</li>
        <p>Maradona captained Argentina again in the 1990 World Cup in Italy to yet another World Cup final. An ankle
          injury affected his overall performance, and he was much less dominant than four years earlier. After losing
          their opening game to Cameroon at the San Siro in Milan, Argentina were almost eliminated in the first round,
          only qualifying in third position from their group. In the round of 16 match against Brazil in Turin, Claudio
          Caniggia scored the only goal after being set up by Maradona.


          In the quarter-final, Argentina faced Yugoslavia in Florence; the match ended 0–0 after 120 minutes, with
          Argentina advancing in a penalty shootout even though Maradona's kick, a weak shot to the goalkeeper's right,
          was saved. The semi-final against the host nation Italy at Maradona's club stadium in Naples, the Stadio San
          Paolo, was also resolved on penalties after a 1–1 draw. This time, however, Maradona was successful with his
          effort, daringly rolling the ball into the net with an almost exact replica of his unsuccessful kick in the
          previous round. At the final in Rome, Argentina lost 1–0 to West Germany, the only goal being a controversial
          penalty scored by Andreas Brehme in the 85th minute, after Rudi Völler was adjudged to be fouled.</>
        <li class="world">1994 World Cup :</li>
        <p>At the 1994 World Cup in the United States, Maradona played in only two games (both at the Foxboro Stadium
          near Boston), scoring one goal against Greece, before being sent home after failing a drug test for ephedrine
          doping. After scoring against Greece, Maradona had one of the most remarkable World Cup goal celebrations as
          he ran towards one of the sideline cameras shouting with a distorted face and bulging eyes. This turned out to
          be Maradona's last international goal for Argentina. In the second game, a 2–1 victory over Nigeria which was
          to be his last game for Argentina, he set up both of his team's goals on free kicks, the second an assist to
          Caniggia.

          In his autobiography, Maradona argued that the test result was due to his personal trainer giving him the
          power drink Rip Fuel. His claim was that the U.S. version, unlike the Argentine one, contained the chemical
          and that, having run out of his Argentine dosage, his trainer unwittingly bought the U.S. formula. FIFA
          expelled him from USA '94, and Argentina were subsequently eliminated in the round of 16 by Romania in Los
          Angeles. Maradona also separately claimed that he had an agreement with FIFA, on which the organization
          reneged, to allow him to use the drug for weight loss before the competition in order to be able to play. His
          failed drug test at the 1994 World Cup signalled the end of his international career, which lasted 17 years
          and yielded 34 goals from 91 games, including one winner's medal and one runners-up medal in the World Cup.
